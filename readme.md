# Calculus notes

Hi! This repo is to let people contribute to my calculus 
notes I hastily wrote while trying to pass a 
calculus course.

They weren't polished and contain many bugs! :D

## Please do

	contributors.


----------

It's a fairly large LaTeX document that gets rendered into a PDF which I 
host. Through the magic of pandoc, it can also be rendered into 
different formats.

Stuff!

*	Why `$$` and not `\[`?
	*	Because I didn't know what I was doing.
	*	I haven't read a style guide for TeX.

*	Why one large file and not many smaller ones with includes?
	*	See above.
	*	Feel free to change this.
